    <h1>Optimal Maintenance Policy for Two-stage Single-component System Subject to Extreme Shocks under Imperfect Inspection</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        A majority of industrial systems are inevitably affected by failures due to internal degradation and external shocks. Meanwhile, because of human, measurement or environment errors, inspections which reveal the different states of the system are generally imperfect. However, in the existing literature, little has comprehensively considered the aforementioned aspects. This paper presents a novel imperfect inspection-based maintenance policy for a single-component system with the objective of minimizing the maintenance cost rate per time unit by considering two-stage deterioration and external extreme shock. To obtain the optimal inspection interval and maximum inspection times, a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) algorithm with non-linear improvement strategy of the inertia weight and the discrete variable evolutionary strategy is devised to effectively solve the presented mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems (MINLP). A case study on oil pipeline maintenance is presented to illustrate that: (1) MPSO performs better than Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and Genetic algorithm (GA); (2) The sensitivity analysis shows that optimal maintenance policy is affected similarly by the cost for preventive maintenance and each inspection, and it also illustrates that length of machine age falls when the intensity of extreme shocks or the probability of a false positive inspection rises.
