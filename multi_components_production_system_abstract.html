    <h1>Grouping-maintenance of Multi-components Production System under Ecological Background</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this paper is to propose an opportunistic group maintenance model for a multi-component series 
        system considering reducing CO2 emission and increasing system efficiency, which establishes a maintenance 
        policy to minimize the cost rate of the system life cycle. Structural dependence and economic dependence between 
        the components in a multi-component series system are analyzed to make condition-based maintenance policy. To minimize 
        the cost rate of system life cycle, clustering theory and two decision variables, which include preventative 
        maintenance cycle multiplier and basic preventive maintenance interval of each component, are utilized to make 
        an opportunistic policy for system optimal maintenance under the background of increasing energy efficiency and 
        reducing CO2 emissions. This model can be applied in a multi-component series system considering energy efficiency 
        and its deterioration process, which could be widely used in the centrifugal compressor of oil refineries. Considering 
        the high maintenance cost and low energy efficiency of multi-component systems, this model assists production managers 
        to have a better maintenance of these systems.
