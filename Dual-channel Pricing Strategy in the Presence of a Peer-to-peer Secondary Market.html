    <h1>Dual-channel Pricing Strategy in the Presence of a Peer-to-peer Secondary Market</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        With the significant increase in the market share of online sales, manufacturers transfer to online and offline dual-channel supply chain including both network stores and physical shops. However, the mismatch between products and consumersâ€™ expectations is widespread in online transactions. The online peer-to-peer secondary market provides consumers with a more flexible trading platform for the mismatched products, which competes with the sale of new products. Therefore, to discuss the pricing strategy in the presence of the peer-to-peer secondary market, a two-period model with a single manufacturer, a single retailer, and a peer-to-peer second-hand platform is constructed. Based on Stackelberg game theory, the article analyzes the optimal decision-making process of the chain players. Research shows that after adding the online channel, even if the unit cost for new products, devalued rate of used products, and probability of suitable products change, the manufacturer can still maximize sales profits by increasing the wholesale price. Additionally, when the unit cost for new products is in a high range, using dual-channel selling strategy can improve the profits of both the manufacturer and the retailer. In this case, the reduction of the mismatch enables dual-channel selling strategy to be advantageous in a wider unit cost range.
