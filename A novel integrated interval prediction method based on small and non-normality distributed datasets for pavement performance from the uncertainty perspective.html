    <h1>A novel integrated interval prediction method based on small and non-normality distributed datasets for pavement performance from the uncertainty perspective</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        The uncertainty prediction of pavement performance can promote the intelligent highway tunnel operation and maintenance, but it encounters the challenges of small and non-normality distributed datasets. This paper proposed a novel integrated interval prediction method to overcome these shortcomings, so that we can decrease the uncertainty. This paper also validates the effectiveness of the proposed method using the empirical test of pavement performance data from the Dalian Tunnel in Shanghai, China. The evaluated result of PINAW and PICP achieve the values of 0.2262 and 89.24%, respectively, demonstrating excellent uncertainty prediction. Furthermore, this paper applied the proposed method to other datasets, which exhibits good generalization ability and thereby being beneficial for formulating scientific maintenance decisions and achieving the maximum service benefits of road surfaces. At last, our code will be open-sourced.
